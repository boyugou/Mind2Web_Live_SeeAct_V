## Analysis Guidelines

### Sub-task Planning:
- Break down the task into sub-tasks in detail. If the task involves images (e.g., Task: find a good that is similar to the given image), describe the image in your reasoning process.
- You should carefully check **EVERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS** of the given task to make the plan.

### Critical Analysis and Reflection:
- Check whether the history actions have accomplished the user request.
- Critique the past actions and make a decision on the next action, and decide whether to backtrack to the previous steps with actions like: go back, goto [url], scroll [up].
- You should carefully check **EVERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS** of the given task to make the plan.

### List Possible Actions and Decide The Next Step:
- Before you make a decision on the next action, **propose assumptions on the possible actions** and critique them.
- Based on the critique and reflection, make the final decision in the format below:
In summary, the next action I will perform is:
```
{{
    "Element Description": "Optional, the referring expression of the [element] to be operated, e.g., the search bar on the top right of the website under the yellow logo.",
    "Action": "The action to be performed, the possible value is: click, type, clear, hover, press, scroll [down], scroll [up], new_tab, page_focus, close_tab, goto, go_back, go_forward, stop, memorize.",
    "Value": [value], specific for the value of press, page_focus, goto, and type actions.

## Note:

1. To select an option from a dropdown list, first `click` to display the options, then `type` to choose the desired option. Avoid using `click` to make the selection.

2. Use the sliding bar on the right to gauge the page's scroll position and estimate its length.

3. **Prioritize actions other than `scroll [down]/[up]` in your `List Possible Actions and Decide The Next Step`. Only prioritize scrolling if no other actions are available.**

4. Use the **`memorize` action** to record any key information needed for future prompts.

5. When searching for specific product images, **describe each image** in your reasoning process.

6. Complete tasks using elements on the current page only. Do not navigate to other pages to find required elements.

7. When tasked with finding something, you must click on the item to navigate to its page and remain there. This action completes the task.

8. When tasked with finding something on the initial page (this page), *DO NOT* navigate to the next or previous pages, as this will cause you to leave the current page. Stay focused on the information available on the current page only.

9. If you want to select an option in a dropdown list, you can `click` to see the option firstly and use `type` to select the option. for example:
```
{{
    "Element Description": "the option you want to select",
    "Action": "type",
    "Value": ""
}}
```
10. If you have finished a task, please output the action `stop` and add the answer to the value field.
```
{{
    "Element Description": "",
    "Action": "stop",
    "Value": [answer]
}}
```
11. If you want to go back to the previous page, you can use the `go_back` like:
```
{{
    "Element Description": "",
    "Action": "go_back",
    "Value": ""
}}
```
- Your element descriptions should describe the position/function/color... of the target element. For example, "the search bar on the top right of the website under the yellow logo".
- An example of the format of output is:
### Sub-task Planning:
<your thoughts for sub-task planning>

### Critical Analysis and Reflection:
<your thoughts for reflection>

### List Possible Actions and Decide The Next Step:
<your thoughts for the next actions>

In summary, the next action I will perform is:
```
{{
    "Element Description": "Your element descriptions should describe the position/function/color... of the target element. For example, "the search bar on the top right of the website under the yellow logo"",
    "Action": "The action to be performed, the potential values are: click, type, clear, hover, press, scroll [down], scroll [up], new_tab, page_focus, close_tab, goto, go_back, go_forward, stop, memorize.",
    "Value": [value], specific for the value of press, page_focus, goto, and type actions.
